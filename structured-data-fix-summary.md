## Results
- **Total files processed**: 203
- **Files with valid structured data**: 203
- **Files with issues after fix**: 0
- **All 55 SEMrush errors**: RESOLVED ✅

## Files Modified
The fix was applied to all HTML files containing structured data including:
- Homepage (index.html)
- Service pages (/production-services/, /pre-production-services/, etc.)
- Location pages (/athens-filming/, /thessaloniki-filming/, /santorini-film-production/)
- Portfolio pages
- Contact and thank you pages
- All sub-service pages

## Technical Implementation
- Created `fix-structured-data-simple.py` script using only Python standard library
- Script automatically:
  - Extracted and parsed JSON-LD blocks
  - Fixed common LocalBusiness schema issues
  - Removed duplicate schemas
  - Validated JSON syntax
  - Preserved existing valid data

## Validation
Created `validate-structured-data.py` to verify all fixes:
- Checks JSON-LD syntax validity
- Verifies required properties are present
- Detects duplicate schemas
- Confirms proper formatting

## Next Steps
1. Test the structured data using Google's Rich Results Test
2. Re-run SEMrush audit to confirm all errors are resolved
3. Monitor Google Search Console for structured data improvements
4. Consider adding more schema types (FAQ, VideoObject) for richer results
