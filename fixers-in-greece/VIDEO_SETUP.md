The website will automatically check for the video file in these locations (in order of preference):

2. **Developer Console:** Check browser console for video status messages
3. **Visual Check:** Video should autoplay on page load (muted)

### Troubleshooting

**Video not loading?**
- Check file name is exactly `home-video.mp4`
- Verify file is in `/assets/` directory
- Ensure file is accessible via web browser
- Check file format (MP4 recommended)

**Video not autoplaying?**
- Modern browsers block autoplay with sound

### Development vs Production

### Performance Tips
