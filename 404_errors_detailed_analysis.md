## 4. Film Crew Pages (1 404)

### Issue:

### Reality:
- The editor page exists at: `/film-crew/creative-roles/editor/`
- There is no "post-production-roles" category under film-crew
- Film crew is organized into: creative-roles, technical-roles, and support-roles

**Action Required:** Either:
1. Create redirect from `/film-crew/post-production-roles/editor/` to `/film-crew/creative-roles/editor/`
2. Or update the linking page to use the correct URL

1. Create redirect from `/pre-production-services/location-scouting/` to `/pre-production-services/location-scouting-services/`
2. Or update the linking page to use the correct URL

## 6. Other Pages (1 404)

### Issue:
- `/services/` - **Directory doesn't exist**

### Reality:
- There is no main "services" directory
- Services are organized into specific categories: production-services, pre-production-services, post-production-services, etc.

**Action Required:** Either:
1. Create a main services page that links to all service categories
2. Or redirect to an appropriate existing page (like the homepage or a specific service category)

## Recommendations Priority

### High Priority (Quick Fixes via Redirects):
1. `/film-crew/post-production-roles/editor/` → `/film-crew/creative-roles/editor/`
2. `/pre-production-services/location-scouting/` → `/pre-production-services/location-scouting-services/`
3. `/services/` → Consider redirecting to homepage or creating a services overview page

### Medium Priority (Create Missing Pages):
1. Production Equipment pages (9 pages) - These are core service offerings
2. Production Team pages (8 pages) - Important for showcasing capabilities
3. Specialized Filming pages (14 pages) - Demonstrates technical expertise

### Implementation Strategy:
1. **Immediate:** Set up 301 redirects for the 3 incorrect URLs
2. **Phase 1:** Create the 9 production equipment pages
3. **Phase 2:** Create the 8 production team pages
4. **Phase 3:** Create the 14 specialized filming pages

## Total Pages Needed:
- **31 new pages** need to be created
- **3 redirects** need to be implemented

This would resolve all 34 404 errors identified in the SEMrush report.
