## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Create Missing Production Services Pages
The production services section has the most 404 errors and likely represents important content for the business. These pages should be created with:
- Detailed descriptions of each service/equipment type
- Specifications and capabilities
- Relevant images/galleries
- Contact information for inquiries

### Priority 2: Fix Main Services Page
The `/services/` page is likely a key navigation page. This should be restored immediately or redirected to an appropriate existing page.

### Priority 3: Create Missing Film Crew and Pre-Production Pages
These individual pages should be created to complete the site structure:
- Editor page under film crew section
- Location scouting page under pre-production services

### Alternative Solutions

If creating all these pages is not feasible immediately, consider:

1. **Implement 301 Redirects**: Redirect these URLs to relevant parent category pages
2. **Create a Custom 404 Page**: Ensure your 404 page helps users find what they're looking for
3. **Remove Internal Links**: Find and remove any internal links pointing to these non-existent pages
4. **Update Sitemap**: Ensure these URLs are not included in your XML sitemap

## Next Steps

1. Audit internal links to find where these 404 URLs are being referenced
2. Check if these pages previously existed and were accidentally deleted
3. Prioritize page creation based on business importance and search traffic
4. Implement redirects for any pages that won't be recreated
5. Set up monitoring to catch 404 errors early in the future
